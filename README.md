## Technologies

#### Project Stack

The project was created using Next.js, Tailwind CSS and TypeScript

#### Choice explanation

I'm not a big fan of using dozens of frameworks, but the first two ones on the list are required for many frontend positions out there, so having on-hands experience with the following is nice-to-have either way.

UPD: 8 months in, not a single job offer requiring knowledge of Tailwind nor Next so far, but I sincerely love working with the latter nowadays.

## Goal

This is a portfolio website created for my ex-girlfriend, breaking up with who didn't make her any less talented (you could check out her instagram [here](https://www.instagram.com/nefarious.kas/))

## Local deployment

Honestly, I've only open-sourced it in case my hypothetic employers ever want to make sure I have actual experience with Tailwind and Next.js, so it would be highly appreciated if you avoided copying the project. Nonetheless, I'm not exactly stopping you from running a local instance of it (as long as you don't eventually deploy it since my moral compass is saying that would make you a huge douche), so all you need to do in order to run one is: 

* (optional) Change the instagram ID you wanna fetch [here](https://github.com/losbiw/kas-portfolio/blob/main/pages/portfolio.tsx#L35)
* Install project's dependencies: ```yarn install```
* Run: ```yarn dev```
