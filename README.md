## Technologies
#### Project Stack
The project was created using Next.js, Tailwind CSS and TypeScript
#### Choice explanation
I'm not a big fan of using dozens of frameworks, but the first two ones I've listed are required for some certain jobs, so an experience of making actual project using them is nice-to-have either way.

## Goal

This is a portfolio website created for my girlfriend (whose instagram you could check out [here](https://www.instagram.com/nefarious.kas/) btw)

## Local deployment

Honestly, it's only open sourced in case my hypothetic employers will want to see my projects that use Tailwind and Next.js, so it would be highly appreciated if you could avoid copying the project. Nevertheless, I'm not exactly stopping you from running your local instance of it, so all you need to do in order to run one is: 

* (optional) Change the instagram ID you wanna fetch [here](https://github.com/losbiw/kas-portfolio/blob/main/pages/portfolio.tsx#L35)
* Install project's dependencies: ```yarn install```
* Run: ```yarn dev```
